This project implements the following algorithms and presents a comparison:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. SVM
4. K Neighbours
5. Random Forest Classifier
6. Decision tree

Dataset: Please check out this [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06792) for dataset information.

This project was carried for the course 'Data Mining (Fall-2021)' at the National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST) Islamabad. Description of files:

`Full_Project`: Script implemented the above algorithms in a single place.

`KMeans`: To separate this algorithm and perform some other tests, this script serves the purpose. Contains runned cell with outputs.

`LogReg`: Implements Logistic Regression

`Project_Visualization`: To consolidate the project visuals in a single file, this script contains all the images.

The Presentation file is also preseneted.
